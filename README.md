# Responsive for knockout.js
Responsive is a component that you supply us multiple size classes and we apply which ever class fits best based on the parent div.

This specific version is a knockout component. There are sibling components for other libraries.

# Example
Feel free to see the example here:
https://snowcoders.github.io/responsive-knockout/example/

Resize your browser window and you will see the number of cells decrease (first 9, then 4 then 1) based on the width of the window.

# To download and run the source
1. git clone https://github.com/snowcoders/responsive-knockout.git
2. npm install
3. npm run all - Builds the library and runs all tests
